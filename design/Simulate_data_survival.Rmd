Continuing from the design of baseline covariates, we consider how to implement survival data simulation.

# 2. Survival Design

For survival we need to specify in addition:

 - baseline hazard parameters
 - HR:
   - internal/external HR "drift"
   - covariate HR coefficients
   - treatment effect HR

```{r}

# each of these builds up the object
# nothing needs to generate any data
#
# implement generate() method for all of them
# generate methods are recursive,
# highest level would take n=N repeat from highest level
#


baseline_obj %>%
  generate() %>%
  design_matrx(~ sex + trt + ext) %>%
  linear_predictor(betas = c(sex = 0.3, trt = 1, ext = 1.1)) %>%
  simulate_survival(hazard_model = weibull_ph(shape = 1, scale = 0.9)) %>%
  survival_matrix()

generate(baseline_obj()) %>%
  mutate(age2 = age^2) %>%
  design_matrix(~ sex + trt + ext)

baseline_design <- design_matrix(baseline_obj, ~ sex + I(age^2) + trt + ext, preprocess_fun = function(data) data)
baseline_design2 <- design_matrix(baseline_obj, ~., preprocess_fun = function(data) data$age2 <- data$age^2)
colnames(baseline_design)


baseline_predictor <- linear_predictor(
  design = baseline_design, # matrix
  betas = c(
    sex = .3,
    "I(age^2)" = .4,
    trt = 1,
    ext = 1.1
  )
)

simulate_survival(
  baseline_predictor,
  hazard_model = weibull_ph(shape = 0.76, lambda = 1) # is a function that takes vector of LPs and gives vector of times
)

survival_matrix(
  baseline_design,
  surv_times = simulate_survival(baseline_predictor, hazard_model = weibull_ph(shape = 0.76, lambda = 1)),
  censor_times = censor(),
  recruitment = recruitment()
)
```

Refer to psborrow for how these can be calculated and combined.

- recruitment rate
- cut off
- censoring
