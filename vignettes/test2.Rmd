## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
library(memisc)
lm0 <- lm(sr ~ pop15 + pop75, data = LifeCycleSavings)
lm1 <- lm(sr ~ dpi + ddpi, data = LifeCycleSavings)
lm2 <- lm(sr ~ pop15 + pop75 + dpi + ddpi, data = LifeCycleSavings)

mtable123 <- mtable(
  "Model 1" = lm0, "Model 2" = lm1, "Model 3" = lm2,
  summary.stats = c("sigma", "R-squared", "F", "p", "N")
)


mtable123 <- relabel(mtable123,
  "(Intercept)" = "Constant",
  pop15 = "Percentage of population under 15",
  pop75 = "Percentage of population over 75",
  dpi = "Real per-capita disposable income",
  ddpi = "Growth rate of real per-capita disp. income"
)


show_html(mtable123, output = "stdout")
```
