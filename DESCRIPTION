Description: An R package for complex, innovative trial designs using
   Bayesian dynamic borrowing (BDB). ‘psborrow’ has two main goals: 
   First, facilitate simulation studies that compare different borrowing 
   parameters (e.g. full borrowing, no borrowing, dynamic borrowing) and 
   other trial and borrowing characteristics (e.g. sample size, covariates) in 
   a unified way; and second, provide a user-friendly interface for applying BDB
   on the study results handles the MCMC sampling on behalf of the user.
